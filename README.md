| Criteria                         | Excellent (10-9)                          | Good (8-7)                               | Satisfactory (6-5)                        | Needs Improvement (4-3)                 | Unsatisfactory (2-0)                     | Score  |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------|
| **Data Structure Design**        | Data structure is well-defined, flexible, and accounts for cubes of any size; efficient storage in memory. | Data structure is mostly well-defined, supports cubes of any size, and shows good memory use. | Data structure is functional but lacks flexibility or efficiency in some cases. | Data structure is incomplete or inefficient, showing little consideration for flexibility or memory usage. | Data structure is missing or inappropriate for the task. | /10    |
| **Layer Rotation Logic**         | Clear and accurate implementation of layer rotation with proper effects on adjacent faces. | Implementation is mostly accurate but may have minor errors in layer rotation logic or adjacent face handling. | Layer rotation is implemented but contains significant errors in adjacent face handling. | Layer rotation is incomplete or does not affect adjacent faces correctly. | No layer rotation logic implemented. | /10    |
| **Explanation of Scoping Rules** | Thorough, accurate explanation of static and dynamic scoping rules and their effects on output. | Good explanation of static and dynamic scoping with minor inaccuracies or missing details. | Explanation is provided but contains major inaccuracies or is lacking in clarity. | Partial explanation of scoping rules with little clarity or detail. | No explanation of scoping rules. | /10    |
| **Pseudocode Implementation**    | Pseudocode is clear, logically sound, and covers all relevant scenarios. | Pseudocode is mostly correct, with minor logic issues. | Pseudocode works but lacks clarity or contains significant logical errors. | Pseudocode is incomplete or unclear, affecting overall logic. | No pseudocode or entirely incorrect implementation. | /10    |
| **Handling of Cube Size Variations** | Cube size variation is fully supported and implemented effectively. | Cube size variation is mostly supported but may have minor limitations in the implementation. | Cube size variation is considered but not fully implemented or contains major issues. | Cube size variation is mentioned but not effectively supported in the implementation. | No consideration for cube size variation in the implementation. | /10    |
| **Efficiency of the Solution**   | Solution is highly efficient in terms of both memory and computational complexity. | Solution is mostly efficient, with minor areas of improvement for larger cubes. | Solution works but has significant inefficiencies in memory or computation. | Solution is inefficient and may not work well for larger cubes. | Solution is highly inefficient or impractical for the problem. | /10    |
| **Clarity and Code Quality**     | Code is well-organized, easy to read, and follows clear structure and naming conventions. | Code is mostly organized and readable but may have some minor issues in structure or naming. | Code works but is hard to read or follow due to poor organization. | Code is poorly organized and difficult to understand. | Code is incomprehensible or disorganized to the point of being unusable. | /10    |
